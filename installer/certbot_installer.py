    Installs Certbot and its Nginx plugin through apt package manager.

    This function attempts to install Certbot and its Nginx plugin using elevated permissions. It uses a
    logger to output structured status messages. Should an error occur during the installation, it logs
    the error and raises the encountered exception to propagate the issue further up the call stack.
    Considerations include whether or not the apt cache update should always be performed here.

        app_settings (AppSettings): Configuration settings that include operational parameters, such as
