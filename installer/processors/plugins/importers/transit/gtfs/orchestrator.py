    Custom exception indicating a configuration error specific to GTFS handling.

    This exception is raised when there is a problem with the configuration

    be used to signal errors such as missing configuration values, improper
    settings, or other related issues. This class is intended to encapsulate

    Processes and sets up a General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) environment
    by validating configuration, running an ETL pipeline, and configuring cron jobs
    for automation. This function ensures the essential parameters, such as the
    GTFS feed URL, are configured correctly in `app_settings`. The setup process
    includes configuring the environment, executing the ETL pipeline, and verifying
    its results, followed by scheduling updates with a cron job. Uses an optional
    logger for detailed logging of operations during the setup.

    Parameters:
        app_settings (AppSettings): Configuration settings for GTFS processing,
            including symbols, GTFS feed URL, and database parameters.
        orchestrator_logger (Optional[logging.Logger]): Logger instance for
            recording messages during the GTFS setup. If not provided, a default
            module logger is used.

    Raises:
        GTFSConfigError: If the required GTFS feed URL is missing in the configuration.
        RuntimeError: If a runtime error occurs during the GTFS processing.
        Exception: For any other unexpected errors encountered during the setup process.
