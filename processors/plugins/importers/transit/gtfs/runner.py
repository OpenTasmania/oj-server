    Runs the GTFS ETL pipeline and verifies the data import.

    This function serves as the main entry point for executing the GTFS ETL (Extract,
    Transform, Load) pipeline and validating its results. The pipeline processes the GTFS
    data using environment configurations and logs its execution. It also includes a
    verification step to ensure the success of the data import by querying relevant GTFS
    tables.

    Arguments:
        app_settings: An instance of AppSettings containing the application configuration.
        current_logger: An optional logger instance to use for logging. If not provided,
            a module-level logger will be used.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If the GTFS ETL pipeline core module cannot be imported.
        RuntimeError: If the GTFS ETL pipeline execution fails.

    Returns:
        None
